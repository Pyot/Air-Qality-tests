# Air Pollution Website

My first website where I use Javascript and extrenal API.
I do not refactor this project even though is not the best. I made after 3 days of playing with Javascript. I was more focused, to make it work, not how the code should look.
I event didn't have a clue that there is something like refactoring :) that day. It is my first child and I love it as it is ;D. So don't say nothing just watch.

## Technologies used for this project:

* JavaScirpt
* [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - The web framework
* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - The CSS animation library
* HTML
* CSS
